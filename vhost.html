  A <i>virtual host</i> is a single website hosted on your server. It
  can be known by many names (through aliases), but always has one
  primary name like 'www.example.com'. The webroot of the site is
  created in the homedir of the user that owns the domain you are
  adding a virtual host to. If you choose a name that starts with
  'www', OpenPanel will automatically add an alias without that prefix:
  www.example.net will also work as http://example.net/.
